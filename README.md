# DBMonitoring
This project aims to develop a Courier Payroll Management System, a GTK app built with C#, that provides efficient and accurate calculation of courier salaries and facilitates the storage of relevant information for statistical and financial purposes. The application offers several functionalities, including the addition and removal of employees, work log management, salary calculation, and report generation.

The architecture of the system consists of a server-side and a client-side. The client-side is divided into two layers: the application layer responsible for the app's functionality and the interface layer responsible for the graphical user interface and communication with the server-side. The classes, methods, and fields used in both the client-side and server-side are described and implemented to ensure proper interaction and data management.
